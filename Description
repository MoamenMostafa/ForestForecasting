Two projects were created one for the forecasting process , and the other one was for Unit Testing the result calculated for the AVG and Accumlation for the weather
degrees .

- Forecast Project :
A Node class was created to specify the generating of degrees to simulate the sensor that reads the temprature degrees .
A Client class was created  to process the tempratures degrees that is generated in Node class and getting the AVG and ACC .

 - UnitTest Project :
 The purpose of this was to unit test the result calculated for the AVG and Accumlation for the weather degrees .
